# custom-ai-library
- This is a custom AI library that I am making so I can practice and understand how AI works under the hood. It is also just a little project to keep me thinking and challenge me as well as an area to experiment with different Ideas I have for AI.
- (Update) I have continued learning about AI/ML and this has helped me with the foundational things and getting an idea of how functions look under the hood.
- This project reflects my early stages of my self-taught AI learning journey.
- In the near future will I post the Neural Netowrks I have been building using the Pytorch library.
